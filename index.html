    <h1 align=center> Low grade "journalists" and internet mob attack
      RMS with lies. In-depth review.</h1>
    <small>Document version: 2.2</small>
    <p> Low grade <q>journalism</q> is making another victim.
      Philosopher and activist Richard Matthew Stallman is having his
      ideas distorted and his writings taken out of context just so a
      <q>journalist</q> can get re-tweets from people that didn't
      even read their article.

    <p class=hl> After reading this, if you agree that Stallman
      suffered an injustice please consider signing this <a
      href="https://www.change.org/p/journalists-to-stop-the-persecution-of-stallman-and-apologize-publicly"
							    >petition</a>, and showing this article to all your friends.

    <p> Now to what actually happened. In chronological order. (Not as
      long as it seems. Most of it are quotations from original sources
      because I'm not an incompetent <q>journalist</q>.)

    <h2>First some background.</h2>

    <p> Jeffrey Edward Epstein was an American financier and convicted
      sex offender. Epstein began his professional life as a teacher,
      then changed to the banking and finance sector in various roles.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein">Epstein
      developed an elite social circle, and allegedly procured women
      and girls, many underage, to provide sexual services for himself
      and some of these contacts.</a>

    <p> <strong>On August 9, 2019</strong> the news site The Verge published <a
      href="http://archive.is/SOXb4">an article</a> about the
      testimony of one of Epstein victims. The woman
      says she was directed by Epstein to have sex with Marvin Minsky. Mr. Minsky
      was a pioneer on artificial intelligence research and a professor
      at MIT. Stallman was also a pioneer at AI research at MIT.

    <h2>The storm begins.</h2>

    <p> <strong>One month later</strong> an article was posted to
      medium, with the title <a href="http://archive.is/Tz0Zr"><q
      cite="http://archive.is/Tz0Zr">Remove Richard Stallman - And
      everyone else horrible in tech.</q></a> by Ms. Selam. There was
      a facebook event calling for a protest regarding donations
      Jeffrey Epstein made to MIT. Stallman objected to the wording of
      the description of the event. Objecting to choices of words is
      something he is known for doing, he is a philosopher after all.
      It would be wrong to jump to the conclusion that he did so only
      to protect a friend.

    <p>The objection was the following:

    <blockquote>
      <p> The announcement of the Friday event does an injustice to
        Marvin Minsky:

      <p><q>deceased AI <q>pioneer</q> Marvin Minsky (who is
        accused of assaulting one of Epstein's victims)</q>

      <p>The injustice is in the word <q>assaulting</q>. The term <q
        >sexual assault</q> is so vague and slippery that it
        facilitates accusation inflation: taking claims that someone
        did X and leading people to think of it as Y, which is much
        worse than X.

      <p>The accusation quoted is a clear example of inflation. The
        reference reports the claim that Minsky had sex with one of
        Epstein's harem. (See <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed">https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed</a>) Let's
        presume that was true (I see no reason to disbelieve it).

      <p>The word <q>assaulting</q> presumes that he applied force
        or violence, in some unspecified way, but the article itself
        says no such thing. Only that they had sex.

      <p>We can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible
        scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely
        willing. Assuming she was being coerced by Epstein, he would
        have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from most of
        his associates.

      <p>I've concluded from various examples of accusation inflation
        that it is absolutely wrong to use the term <q>sexual
        assault</q> in an accusation.

      <p>Whatever conduct you want to criticize, you should describe
        it with a specific term that avoids moral vagueness about the
        nature of the criticism.
    </blockquote>

    <p>We can note two things here:

    <ol>
      <li> He <b>is not</b> disbelieving the possibility that Mr.
        Minsky did indeed have intercourse with a minor. <q>Let's
        presume that was true (I see no reason to disbelieve it).</q>

      <li> He <b>is</b> saying that the girl could have presented
        herself as entirely willing. This means that Mr. Minsky would
        not be aware of the fact that girl was being forced to have sex
        with him. It's very important to understand that he said that
        the girl <b>could</b> have <b>presented</b> herself as
        willingly. He <b>did not</b> say that the girl was in fact
        willingly having sex with Mr. Minsky.
    </ol>

    <p> The article goes to on to say, shortly after, quoting this
      same e-mail, that:

    <blockquote>
      <p> &hellip;and then he says that an enslaved child could,
        somehow, be <q>entirely willing</q>.
    </blockquote>

    <p> Which we can clearly see he did not do. The author of the
      article is a mechanical engineer and a not a professional
      journalist. Moreover she admits to be very upset while writing
      the article. So maybe this was an innocent mistake.

    <p> The rest of the article talks about the under-representation
      of women in STEM and Includes a picture of Stallman's room door
      at MIT with a sign that reads:

    <blockquote>
      <p> Richard Stallman: Knight for justice (Also: Hot ladies)
    </blockquote>

    <p> then two more pictures of Stallman's emails deemed <q
      >problematics</q> and <a href="http://archive.is/IhNRw">a
      link</a> to the geek feminism wiki with other <q>problematic</q
      > quotes.

    <p>The article ends with:

    <blockquote>
      <p> Perhaps the only criticism I will accept is that I,
        personally, have been lucky enough to avoid a lot of
        gender-related discrimination in comparison to my peers.
    </blockquote>

    <p> Unfortunately it seems that this person is not open to
      criticisms.

    <h3>The disinformation machine at work.</h3>

    <p> <strong>On September 13, 2019</strong> the periodic
      MOTHERBOARD published an article titled <a
      href="http://archive.is/xIwP2"><q>Famed Computer Scientist
      Richard Stallman Described Epstein Victims As 'Entirely
      Willing'</q></a>.

    <p> As we've seen, Stallman did not say or imply that one girl was
      entirely willingly having sex with Mr. Minsky, much less that all
      of Epstein victims were (note the letter <q>s</q> on the title
      of the article after the <q>victim</q> word, denoting plural).

    <p> As we've seen, Stallman said that one girl <b>could</b> have
      <b>presented</b> herself to Mr. Minsky willingly.

    <p> The article then goes on with its defamation, the first
      paragraph reads:

    <blockquote>
      <p> Richard Stallman, the computer scientist best known for his
        role in the free software movement, has joined the list of MIT
        men going out of their way to defend the university's
        relationships with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    </blockquote>

    <p> The <q>journalist</q> uses the article posted by Ms. Selam
      on medium(the one above) as its source. The defamation goes on:

    <blockquote>
      <p> Early in the thread, Stallman insists that the <q>most
        plausible scenario</q> is that Epstein's underage victims were
        <q>entirely willing</q> while being trafficked.
    </blockquote>

    <p> Again two mistakes. Stallman did not talk about all of Epstein
      victims and he did not say that they were entirely willingly.

    <p> All this misinformation is then followed by:

    <blockquote>
      <p> Stallman goes on to argue about the definition of <q>sexual
        assault,</q> <q>rape,</q> and whether they apply to Minsky
        and Giuffre's deposition statement that she was forced to have
        sex with him.

      <p> In response to a student pointing out that Giuffre was 17
        when she was forced to have sex with Minsky in the Virgin
        Islands, Stallman said <q>it is morally absurd to define <q
        >rape</q> in a way that depends on minor details such as which
        country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or
        17.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <p> None of which is contained the medium article by Ms. Selam.
      Instead, this is all in a 20 page screen shot of a mail list <a
      href="https://anonfile.com/8fbfl96fnb/mail-list_copy_obtained_by_Vice_pdf"
      >at the bottom of the page</a>. The screen shot has 20 pages
      because the <q>journalist</q> didn't bother formatting it for
      presentation, he just detracted addresses from other people that
      not Stallman. It has in fact around 10 very short messages. If you want to read it, go from the last page to the first.

    <p> The message from which the quote: <q>it is morally absurd to
      define <q>rape</q> [&hellip;]</q> was taken is this one:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em>Giuffre was 17 at the time; this makes it __rape__ in
        the Virgin Isiands.</em> <em>Does it really? I think it is
        morally absurd to define <q>rape</q> in a</em> <em>way that
        depends on minor details such as which country it was in or</em
        > <em>whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.</em>

      <p> <em>I think the existence of a dispute about that supports
        my point that</em> <em>the term <q>sexual assault</q> is
        slippery, so we ought to use more</em> <em>concrete terms
        when accusing anyone.</em>

      <p> <em>&gt; The Verge article includes the deposition snippet,
        which is not ambiguous at all: Giuffre directly
        says she was forced to have sex with
        Minsky.</em>

      <p> <em>I don't see any quotation from the deposition in the
        article, but it says, <q>Giuffre says she was
        directed to have sex with Minsky.</q> Given the
        circumstances, that implies she was coerced by Epstein into
        doing so.</em>

      <p> <em>The article I know of, and have a copy of, is</em> <em
        ><a

        so, would you like to</em> <em>tell me its URL?</em>

      <p> Let's stop grasping at straws to defend our
        friends, and instead listen to the women who
        were harmed.</em>

      <p> <em>We can listen only to what is said to us.</em>

      <p> <em>All i know she said about Minsky is that Epstein
        directed her to have</em> <em>sex with Minsky. That does not
        say whether Minsky knew that she was</em> <em>coerced. It
        does not report what each said and did during their</em> <em
        >sexual encounter. We can imagine various scenarios.</em>

      <p> <em>We know that Giuffre was being coerced into sex -- by
        Epstein. She</em> <em>was being harmed. But the details do
        affect whether, and to what</em> <em>extent, Minsky was
        responsible for that.</em>

      <p> <em>Looking through the article again carefully, I found a
        link that reportedly</em> <em>points to the deposition
        itself. I visited that URL and got a blank window. It is on
        Google Drive, which demands running nonfree software in order
        to see it. See </em> <em><a
        href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html"

        part that pertains to Minsky? I say <q>not anyone else</q> to
        avoid getting 20 copies. </em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>As we can see, his point can be boiled down to:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em> We know that Giuffre was being coerced into sex -- by
        Epstein. She was being harmed. But the details do affect
        whether, and to what extent, Minsky was responsible for that.
        </em>
    </blockquote>

    <p> Or in other words, that the girl <b>could</b> have <b
      >presented</b> herself to Mr. Minsky as willingly.

    <p> The articles then talks about the resignation of another
      completely different professor, Joi Ito, for reasons that are
      beyond my understanding.

    <p> <strong>Also on September 13, 2019</strong> another
      (un)renowned information source, The Daily Beast, published a article  on the subject. The title of this one was <a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190917134307/https://www.thedailybeast.com/famed-mit-computer-scientist-richard-stallman-defends-epstein-victims-were-entirely-willing"
      ><q
      >Renowned MIT Scientist Defends Epstein: Victims Were <q
      >Entirely Willing</q> - MIT bigwig Richard Stallman dismissed
      Epstein's underage victims in emails and defended child pornography on his blog.</a></q>

    <p>It starts with:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em> While MIT engages in damage control following
        revelations the university's Media Lab accepted millions of
        dollars in funding from Jeffrey Epstein, a renowned computer
        scientist at the university has fanned the flames by apparently
        going out of his way to defend the accused sex trafficker
        &mdash; and child pornography in general. </em>
    </blockquote>

    <p> As we've seen, Stallman did not defend the sex trafficker,
      Epstein, he merely criticized the wording used to refer to Mr.
      Minsky. Crude mistake for such a renowned information source.

    <p>They then go on to repeat the same thing as The Verge:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em> his eminence in the academic computer science
        community came into question Friday afternoon when purportedly
        leaked email excerpts showed him suggesting one of Epstein's
        alleged victims was <q>entirely willing.</q> </em>
    </blockquote>

    <p> Stallman never said the victims were <q>entirely willingly</q
      >, only that they <b>could</b> have been <b>presented</b> to
      Mr. Minsky as entirely willingly, as we've seen in the original
      emails above. But hey, it's 2019, what do we need fact for, right?

    <p> The author then mentions the fact that the emails are
      available in full and repeats the same mistake.

    <blockquote>
      <p><em> Stallman wrote that <q>the most plausible scenario</q
        > for Giuffre's accusations was that she was, in actuality, <q
        >entirely willing.</q> Vice's Motherboard later reprinted the
        emails in full. Gano did not immediately respond to a request
        for comment. </em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I guess they are being paid to write, not read, right?

    <p> The renowned news paper report on the matter ends here. The
      rest of the article, which constitutes most of it, is actually
      just quotations from Stallmans personal blog that are deemed <q
      >questionable</q>. Nothing he posted at the MIT mailing list. At
      the top of his <a href="https://stallman.org">blog</a> we can read:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em> This is the personal web site of Richard Stallman. The
        views expressed here are my personal views, not those of the
        Free Software Foundation or the GNU Project. </em>
    </blockquote>

    <p> But <q>journalists</q> are paid to write, not read. And all
      the other cool kids are already playing witch hunt anyways so
      what?

    <p>The first quote from stallman's blog is:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em> <q>This <q>child pornography</q> might be a photo
        of yourself or your lover that the two of you shared. It might
        be an image of a sexually mature teenager that any normal adult
        would find attractive. What's heinous about having such a
        photo?</q> Stallman wrote in 2011 on his personal site,
        stallman.org, in an argument in favor of Congress limiting
        laptop searches at the U.S. border.</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p> Which does not include an URL, fortunately, I bothered
      searching for it (<a
      href="https://stallman.org/archives/2011-may-aug.html#4_June_2011_(Border_Searches)"
      >https://stallman.org/archives/2011-may-aug.html#4_June_2011_(Border_Searches)</a
      >) :

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em> Campaigning for Congress to limit searches of laptops
        at the US border.</em>

      <p> <em>The same should be done for police when they stop
        drivers.</em>

      <p> <em>The article falls into a common kind of error when it
        says that <q>possession of child pornography is a heinous
        offense</q>. It is the error of rhetorically legitimizing the
        previous attack against our rights in arguing against the next
        one.</em>

      <p> <em>This <q>child pornography</q> might be a photo of
        yourself or your lover that the two of you shared. It might be
        an image of a sexually mature teenager that any normal adult
        would find attractive. What's heinous about having such a
        photo?</em>

      <p> <em>But even when it is uncontroversial to call the subject
        depicted a <q>child</q>, that is no excuse for censorship.
        Having a photo or drawing does not hurt anyone, so and if you
        or I think it is disgusting, that is no excuse for
        censorship.</em>

      <p> <em>The government will invent an unlimited number of
        opportunities to censor us and search us if we grant the
        legitimacy of its all-purpose excuses for doing so.</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It seems that the general points are two.

    <ol>
      <li> The search of laptops should have a probable cause and not
        be preemptive:
        <blockquote>
          <p>the error of rhetorically legitimizing the previous
            attack against our rights in arguing against the next one.
        </blockquote>

      <li> And that, depending on the context, what is technically
        child pornography didn't cause anyone harm.
        <blockquote>
          <p> This <q>child pornography</q> might be a photo of
            yourself or your lover that the two of you shared.
        </blockquote>
    </ol>

    <p>Think of a couple in which one is 19 years old and the other is
      17.

    <p> He then says that the mere possession of child pornography
      does not harm anyone. I assume he is implying that only the
      production of child pornography harms people.

    <blockquote>
      <p><em> But even when it is uncontroversial to call the subject
        depicted a <q>child</q>, that is no excuse for censorship.
        Having a photo or drawing does not hurt anyone, so and if you
        or I think it is disgusting, that is no excuse for
        censorship.</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p> I would disagree with that, but it's his personal blog. He is
      not speaking for the MIT or the free software foundation.

    <p>Also note that he says <q>if you or I think it is
      disgusting</q>.

    <p> Now to the second <q>questionable</q> quote. It very
      conveniently does not have a link but it can be found <a
      href="https://stallman.org/archives/2019-jan-apr.html#25_April_2019_(Plea_deal_for_Epstein)"
      >here</a>. The renowned news source writes:

    <blockquote>
      <p><em> <q>I disagree with some of what the article says about
        Epstein. Epstein is not, apparently, a pedophile, since the
        people he raped seem to have all been postpuberal.</q> He
        preferred to call Epstein a <q>serial rapist.</q> </em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And the writing in its entirety is here:

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>(Now) Labor Secretary Acosta's plea deal for Jeffrey
        Epstein was not only extremely lenient, it was so lenient that
        it was illegal.</em>

      <p><em>I wonder whether this makes it possible to resentence
        him to a longer prison term.</em>

      <p><em>I disagree with some of what the article says about
        Epstein. Epstein is not, apparently, a pedophile, since the
        people he raped seem to have all been postpuberal.</em>

      <p><em>By contrast, calling him a <q>sex offender</q> tends
        to minimize his crimes, since it groups him with people who
        committed a spectrum of acts of varying levels of gravity. Some
        of them were not crimes. Some of these people didn't actually
        do anything to anyone.</em>

      <p><em>I think the right term for a person such as Epstein is
        <q>serial rapist</q>. </em>
    </blockquote>

    <p> So Stallman actually held the opinion that Epstein should have
      gotten a longer sentence and that <q>sex offender</q> was too
      light of a term.

    <p> Maybe we could say that the way the renowned news source quoted
      Stallman is questionable.

    <p> To the third <q>questionable</q> quote. This time at least
      they provided the source (No direct link, search for the quotes,
      <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2003-may-aug.html"
      >https://stallman.org/archives/2003-may-aug.html</a>) but the
      choice of what sentences to include in the article could be
      called questionable.

    <p>The Daily Beast writes:

    <blockquote>
      <p><em> In 2003, he said, <q>I think that everyone age 14 or

    <p> The original blog post contains a <a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180913062002/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/06/pressandpublishing.lords"
      >link to The Guardian</a>. If you read it, you will notice that
      the other people concerned with the bill are the editors of a
      teen magazine that fear they won't be able to offer advice on
      contraceptives to girls that are mostly between the ages of 15
      and 16 years old.

    <p> I wonder if The Daily Beast is against such a thing. It would
      be very questionable for such a renowned news source.

    <p> Now let's pay attention to the wording on the renowned news
      source:

    <blockquote>
      <p><em> also argued against age of consent laws</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p> Implying that Stallman argued against age of consent laws. I
      read this blog post many times and I find this claim to be
      questionable. I'm not a lawyer, I do not know whether such
      accusation is a crime.

    <p>The fourth <a href="https://www.stallman.org/archives/2006-mar-jun.html#05%20June%202006%20(Dutch%20paedophiles%20form%20political%20party)">quote</a> is:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em>Stallman was apparently also quite open about his ideas
        not only on age of consent laws, but also pedophilia. In 2006,
        he wrote, <q>I am skeptical of the claim that voluntarily
        pedophilia harms children. The arguments that it causes harm
        seem to be based on cases which aren't voluntary, which are
        then stretched by parents who are horrified by the idea that
        their little baby is maturing.</q> The law does not allow for
        <q>voluntary</q> pedophilia.</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p> There is not much to say about it, given all his other posts he is probably referring to two kids where one is 17 and the other 19 years old.
    <p>The fifth <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2006-mar-jun.html#06%20April%202006%20(DHS%20spokesman%20sex%20scandal?)">quote</a> is:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em>In 2006, he said it wouldn't so bad for an adult man
        who worked for the Department of Homeland Security to have sex
        with a 14-year-old, as one government employee had
        allegedly[&hellip;]</em> &quot;&quot;
    </blockquote>

    <p> The post in its entirety is here:
      <blockquote>
	 <p><em>Many Americans would see a scandal in the DHS spokesman who has been <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/04/04/homeland.arrest/index.html">arrested for proposing sex to a 14-year-old girl</a> through the Internet.

	 <p>I too see a scandal, but not the same one. I think the scandal is that this man is going to face a prison sentence when he has not done wrong to anyone.

	 <p>Sometimes adults are in a position of power over teenagers (or even children) and use that power to pressure them into sex. That is wrong because it is coercion. Sometimes they manipulate or trick inexperienced people into sex they didn't want. That's not right because it is not honest.

	 <p>But this man seems to have done none of those things. He was chatting with a stranger, clearly not dependent on him in any way. The report gives no reason to think he was pressuring or tricking her. For all we can tell, he was making an honest request. Supposing his interlocutor had been a real girl, if she had not wanted to have sex with him, she would have had no trouble saying "no thanks". And supposing she had voluntarily had sex with him, presuming that they used a condom and suitable contraception, it would have done no harm to either of them.</em> 
      </blockquote>
    <p>Note that in the third paragraph he acknowledges the possibility that in some situation the teenager could be coerced and that this is bad. The author of the article must think this is a minor detail.

    <p>The sixth <q>questionable</q> <a href="https://www.stallman.org/archives/2012-nov-feb.html#04_January_2013_(Pedophilia)">quote</a>:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em>He reiterated his point in 2013: <q>There is little
        evidence to justify the widespread assumption that willing
        participation in pedophilia hurts children.</q></em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Let's see the original:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em>There is little evidence to justify the widespread
        assumption that willing participation in pedophilia hurts
        children.</em>

      <p><em>Granted, children may not dare say no to an older
        relative, or may not realize they could say no; in that case,
        even if they do not overtly object, the relationship may still
        feel imposed to them. That's not willing participation, its
        imposed participation, a different issue.</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p> Who could have guessed that context matters. The integrity of
      this renowned <q>journalist</q> is beginning to look very
      questionable.

      <p>On September 14, 2019 (one day after The Daily Beast published this article) Stallman made a <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2019-jul-oct.html#14_September_2019_(Sex_between_an_adult_and_a_child_is_wrong)">post</a> on his blog stating that he has changed his mind. It reads:
      <blockquote>
	 <p><em>Many years ago I posted that I could not see anything wrong about sex between an adult and a child, if the child accepted it.

<p>Through personal conversations in recent years, I've learned to understand how sex with a child can harm per psychologically. This changed my mind about the matter: I think adults should not do that. I am grateful for the conversations that enabled me to understand why.</em>
	</blockquote>

      <p>He doesn't link to the previous posts he is talking about but it seems reasonable to assume they are the fifth and sixth quotes we just saw.

    <p>You think this is all dirty? There is more:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em>People within the tech industry knew of Stallman's
        remarks, chattering about his controversial claims in social
        networking sites and forums at least since last year, but his
        remarks about Epstein's victims reignited the debate Friday.
        The digital trail of Stallman's remarks and the whisper network
        surrounding them raise the question of whether MIT and the Free
        Software Foundation knew of his controversial statements.</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p> The people on the industry are <a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190920011433/https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17019064"
      >two users of YCombiantor</a> talking about the fourth quote and
      a <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei">woman</a> on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/1172283772428906496">posting</a> the day before the article was
      published and talking about the exact same thing as those two
      articles and using the exact same arguments.

    <p>The seventh questionable quote:

    <blockquote>
      <p>In 2003, he wrote a post about a judge who argued that
        repealing an Alabama anti-sodomy law would lead to the
        legalization of <q>prostitution, adultery, necrophilia,
        bestiality, possession of child pornography, and even incest
        and pedophilia.</q> The computer scientist responded, <q>All
        of these acts should be legal as long as no one is coerced.
        They are illegal only because of prejudice and
        narrowmindedness.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The <a href="https://stallman.org/cgi-bin/showpage.cgi?path=/archives/2003-may-aug.html&term=%22another%20caveman%22&type=norm&case=0">original</a> reads:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em>Dubya has nominated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030720043609/http://mailer.democrats.org:80/rdr/002KK007v70001D">another caveman</a> for a federal
        appeals court. Refreshingly, the Democratic Party is organizing
        opposition. </em> <em>[Reference updated on 2018-05-10
        because the <a href="http://mailer.democrats.org/rdr/002KK007v70001D">old link</a> was broken.]</em>

      <p><em>The nominee is quoted as saying that if the choice of a
        sexual partner were protected by the Constitution,
        &quot;prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality,
        possession of child pornography, and even incest and
        pedophilia&quot; also would be. He is probably mistaken,
        legally--but that is unfortunate. All of these acts should be
        legal as long as no one is coerced. They are illegal only
        because of prejudice and narrowmindedness.</em>

      <p><em>Some rules might be called for when these acts directly
        affect other people's interests. For incest, contraception
        could be mandatory to avoid risk of inbreeding. For
        prostitution, a license should be required to ensure
        prostitutes get regular medical check-ups, and they should have
        training and support in insisting on use of condoms. This will
        be an advance in public health, compared with the situation
        today.</em>

      <p><em>For necrophilia, it might be necessary to ask the next
        of kin for permission if the decedent's will did not authorize
        it. Necrophilia would be my second choice for what should be
        done with my corpse, the first being scientific or medical use.
        Once my dead body is no longer of any use to me, it may as well
        be of some use to someone. Besides, <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/texas.html">I often enjoy
        rhinophytonecrophilia</a> (nasal sex with dead plants).</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p> All those questionable quotes seem very reasonable when put in
      context. I wonder if The Daily Beast finds questionable that sex
      workers should get training, medical check-ups and use condoms.
    <p>I wonder what their readers would think about that.

    <p>The eighth one, this one is kinda funny. The renowned news source writes:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em>Stallman extended his argument to say that internet
        censorship is worse than child pornography: <q>The term <q
        >child pornography</q> is dishonest. The censorship of it puts
        young lovers in direct danger of prosecution. Many published
        works are disgusting, but censorship is more so.</q></em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2011-may-aug.html#29_August_2011_(Child_Pornography_Bill)">original</a> reads:

      <blockquote>
      <p> <em>&quot;Child&quot; pornography is being used as an
        excuse to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/08/24/139875599/child-pornography-bill-makes-privacy-experts-skittish">threaten all American internet users' privacy</a>.</em>

      <p><em>The term &quot;child pornography&quot; <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2011-may-aug.html#4_June_2011_%28Border_Searches%29">is dishonest</a>. The

        prosecution</a>.</em>

      <p><em>Many published works are disgusting, but censorship is
        more so. In the Internet, enforcement of censorship puts other
        rights in danger.</em>

      <p><em>Please support demandprogress.org's campaign against
        this bill.</em>
    </blockquote>
      
      <p>When Stallman says that child pornography is being used to
      threaten internet users, he is linking to a bill, that would force ISPs to save IP addresses logs
      for at least one year.

    <p> When he says that <q>child pornography</q> is dishonest he
      is linking to another of his posts where he opposes himself to the search of laptops at borders without plausible cause.
    <br/>Wait a second. This is the very first post the "journalist" talked about, that one he didn't provide source for.
    <br/>I wonder if he read this before quoting it. I think he didn't, otherwise he would have been able to provide the source to that other <q>questionable</q> quote.
    <br/>Paid to write, not to read, I gues?
    
    <p>The funny part is now.
      <br/>When he says <q>direct danger of prosecution</q>, he is
      linking to <a
      href="https://stallman.org/archives/2011-may-aug.html#29_June_2011_%28Yearbook_Return_Ordered%29"
      >this other post of his</a>:

    <blockquote>
      <p> <em>The &quot;child pornography&quot; witch-hunt has made a
        possession of this high-school yearbook a crime &mdash; because
        of what two students in the background of a photo are doing.
        Imagine if the photo had been published in a newspaper. That
        could turn thousands of people into criminals.</em>

      <p><em>Doing foreplay in a dance is a little daring &mdash; it
        must have been fun. It suggests those two students are normal
        teenagers with a normal interest in sex. If there was anything
        harmful, wrong, or shameful about this photo, it wasn't them.
        Yet (according to an article on a site not suitable to link to)
        they might face prosecution, with the danger of being listed as
        &quot;sex offenders&quot;, effectively &quot;perverts&quot;,
        for being normal and hurting nobody.</em>

      <p><em>These laws are the perverted intersection of two
        irrational hot buttons: &quot;sex is dirty&quot; and &quot;we
        must protect the children&quot;. Remember this when Internet
        filtering is imposed in order to block &quot;child
        pornography&quot;.</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I wonder if the renowned news source thinks teenagers should
      abstain from sex until marriage. Their readers might find such
      position to be questionable.

    <p>The nine-th quote is actually from the same post as the first one but
      this time it does have a link. Apparently the author didn't read
      the sources or even what he wrote. Guess he is really being paid
      to write, not read. Renowned journalism at its best.

    <h2>Back to the beginning.</h2>

    <p> <b>On September 16, 2019</b> Ms. Selam, the one from the
      first blog post, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190920014520/https://medium.com/@selamie/remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88">wrote</a> again. On the third paragraph we read:

    <blockquote>
      <p> I had no idea that Richard Stallman has been so problematic,
        in so many different ways, for so long. I did not know that
        Richard Stallman has been making MIT a worse learning
        environment for decades, and that somehow, that behavior went
        on completely unchecked.
    </blockquote>

    <p> As we've seen he has not been <q>problematic</q>.
      Incompetent <q>journalists</q> have been <q>problematic</q>.

    <p>A few paragraphs below, we have:

    <blockquote>
      <p><a name=8395></a> I hope this gets through to everyone who
        has responded saying we <q>should not jump to conclusions</q>
        or <q>be less punitive</q>. We have been lenientâ€Š&mdash;â€Šin
        fact, we have been negligentâ€Š&mdash;â€Šfor decades.

      <p><a name=7089></a>Others have already dug up a good chunk of
        Stallman's public history. This Daily Beast article does a
        great job covering his long history of problematic views on
        child pornography and statutory rape:
    </blockquote>

    <p> Want to guess what article of The Daily Beast, the renowned
      news source, is linked just below that quote? That's right, the very questionable one
      that we just read above.

    <p> It goes on:

    <blockquote>
      <p>Some people have described Stallman as <q>controversial</q
        >â€Š&mdash;â€Šthis could mean a few different things, but I do not
        think that Stallman's <em>opinions</em> are controversial. <q
        >Controversial</q> implies that 40% of the public thinks one
        way and another 40% the other, and some 20% are in-between.
    </blockquote>

    <p>I think Mr. Merrian-Webster would disagree with that:

    <p><q>Controversial</q> according to Merrian-Webster:

    <blockquote>
      <p> of, relating to, or arousing controversy
    </blockquote>

    <p>In turn, the definition of <q>controversy</q> is:

    <blockquote>
      <p>a discussion marked especially by the expression of opposing
        views
    </blockquote>

    <p> Interesting, this says nothing about percentages. I wonder if
      this very odd definition will prove useful later in the text.

    <p>Let's read the rest of the paragraph:

    <blockquote>
      <p>If there are a large number of people in the United States
        who think that child pornography and sexual intercourse with
        minors should be legalized, this is the first I'm hearing of
        it, and please show me the evidence.
    </blockquote>

    <p> I don't think there is a large number of people in the United States who think that child pornography and sexual intercourse with minors should be legalized and if there are, as we saw, <b>Stallman is not one of them</b>. The paragraph goes on:

    <blockquote>
      <p> Since it is not controversial, I'm not going to argue why
        these opinions are problematic. Having to <q>prove</q> this
        would give legitimacy to Stallman's ideas.
    </blockquote>

    <p>But you already did argue. Not arguing would be to take <q
      >Stallmans opinions are problematic</q> as an axiom. As you said:

    <p> The opinions are not controversial (by your weird definition)
      and you don't like them. =&gt; The opinions are problematic.

    <p> At least we now know what those people call <q>problematic</q
      >.

    <p> Not that any of this matters. This is all, as we've seen, a
      big strawman (pun intended). You are attacking the lies written
      (and not read, he is not being paid for that) of a sub-par <q
      >journalist</q>. That <q>journalist</q> is in turn only writing this
      lies because he saw(not read, he is not being paid for that) your
      last blog post.
      <p>Kinda sounds like an echo chamber.

    <p> A few more gaffes before we go to the next section of the
      article:

    <blockquote>
      <p> MIT, by endorsing Stallman, also gives legitimacy to these
        ideas.
    </blockquote>

    <p> No. It does not. As stated in his blog, his opinions are his
      own. Not that it matters, since you are not attacking his
      opinions, you are attacking the delusions of an illiterate <q
      >journalist</q>.

    <blockquote>
      <p>I would also like to clarify that in some headlines,
        including this Daily Beast one, Stallman is said to have
        defended Epstein, <strong>which is not technically
        true.</strong>Rather, Stallman was defending Marvin Minsky. I
        directly emailed and corrected reporters who used that language
        if I myself had given them any comments or information. I say
        this to show that I never intended to <q>inflate</q>
        anything, because there was absolutely no need to.
    </blockquote>

    <p> Excellent, but unfortunately those reporters are not being
      paid to read, only to write. The headlines and disinformation are
      all still there.

    <blockquote>
      <p><a name=1a69></a>The truth by itself was far, far more than
        enough.
    </blockquote>

    <p>The truth that you got from the <q>journalists</q> that can't
      even write a correct headline or check the facts of his half-page article?

    <p><b>To the second section of the article now. You might have
      already noticed but it has nothing to do with the initial matter
      anymore. Someone hit a target and now wants to make sure it's a
      bullseye.</b>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In this section, I acknowledge that I do not have as many
        photos, emails, or written records as evidence. I do, however,
        have witnesses.
    </blockquote>

    <p>The author then provides the personal experience of a few
      alumni as far back as 1980. The first one:

    <blockquote>
      <p> I recall being told early in my freshman year <q>If RMS
        hits on you, just say <q>I'm a vi user</q> even if it's not
        true.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <p> This seems to be a joke from one student to another, not
      something Stallman did. The joke seems also to be about the fact
      that Stallman is an avid advocate of Emacs and that there is a
      very famous internet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">flame war</a> between Emacs and Vi users. It
      doesn't say anything about Stallman behavior towards women. The
      same joke could have been made about a serial rapist or a noun or anyone that prefers one text editor over another.

    <p>To the second of the <q>horrifying stories</q>:

    <blockquote>
      <p><q> He literally used to have a mattress on the floor of his

        for that reason &hellip; I was one of the course 6 undergrads
        who avoided that part of NE43 precisely for that reason. (the

    <p> Let's take a look at <a

      Stallman's personal website</a>, section <q>Home</q>:

    <blockquote>
      <p> Until around 1998, my office at MIT was also my residence. I

        rarely there, since I am nearly always travelling out of town.

    <p>I wonder what that dirty mattress was used for. Maybe sleeping?

    <p> The next story does sound inappropriate but given the context
      of lies I honestly don't know what to think of it. If it is true,
      I don't think this alone could justify everything that is being
      done to Stallman. I say <q>this alone</q> because, as we've
      seen, the rest are lies and mis-characterizations.

    <blockquote>
      <p> When I was a teen freshman, I went to a buffet lunch at an
        Indian restaurant in Central Square with a graduate student
        friend and others from the AI lab. I don't know if he and I
        were the last two left, but at a table with only the two of us,
        Richard Stallman told me of his misery and that he'd kill
        himself if I didn't go out with him.

      <p> I felt bad for him and also uncomfortable and manipulated. I
        did not like being put in that position &mdash; suddenly
        responsible for an <q>important</q> man. What had I done to
        get into this situation? I decided I could not be responsible
        for his living or dying, and would have to accept him killing
        himself. I declined further contact.

      <p>He was not a man of his word or he'd be long dead.

    <p>The stories end here. The author then gives her opinion:

    <blockquote>
      <p> But MIT is a privileged place. We have the right to choose
        who we admit, hire, or endorse. We do not let just anyone on
        our campus; we demand high standards of achievement. We should
        demand high ethical standards equal to our high standards for
        achievement. I do not think Richard Stallman ever met even a
        low ethical standard for being at any university, and I am
        questioning mostly why this was allowed to continue for so, so
        long.
    </blockquote>

    <p> I also think the MIT should demand
      higher ethical standards.

    <p> The section ends with a link to <a
      href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lazowska/mit">a report</a
      > written by women of the CSAIL in 1980 (the one Stallman worked
      at) about equality in academia. It might be a bit <q>culturally
      dated</q> but it's interesting and still have good ideas that
      could be implemented.

    <p> The fact that the women of the CSAIL wrote a report might
      indicate that the environment was not very women friendly or it
      might indicate that it was so friendly(for the time's standard)
      that they were able to write it.

    <p> Nevertheless, it doesn't say anything about Stallman's conduct,
      since there is not any previous evidence for it to corroborate. As
      we've seen all those <q>questionable</q> opinions and behaviors
      were indeed mis-characterizations.

    <p> The author now goes to the third section, titled: <q>Going
      Forward, be proactive instead of reactive.</q>, and gives some
      genuinely good suggestions to improve an academic environment.
      Unfortunately, her actions were not so good.

    <p>The article ends with:

    <blockquote>
      <p> Today, I found out that Stallman had issued a rather weak
        and confusing apology to the CSAIL mailing list:

      <p> I want to respond to the misleading media coverage of
        messages I posted about Marvin Minsky's association with
        Jeffrey Epstein. The coverage totally mischaracterised my
        statements.

      <p> Headlines say that I defended Epstein. Nothing could be
        further from the truth. I've called him a <q>serial rapist,
        and said he deserved to be imprisoned. But many people now
        believe I defended him &mdash; and other inaccurate claims
        &mdash; and feel a real hurt because of what they believe I
        said. </q>

      <p> I'm sorry for that hurt. I wish I could have prevented the
        misunderstanding.
    </blockquote>

    <p> Which doesn't seem like an apology, but like someone that is
      feeling guilt for being caught in a situation they had no real
      way to avoid and for which they can't be blamed. Victim self blaming.

    <p> Maybe we should end with a quote from someone on the mailing list
      where it all started:

    <blockquote>
      <p> The job of scientists is to evaluate evidence and seek
        truth. We have a social responsibility to do that as well. I
        hope that we scientists will never evade our social
        responsibility to seek and defend the truth out of fear that
        the press will misconstrue our search.
