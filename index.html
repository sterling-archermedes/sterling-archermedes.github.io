<p>Low grade &quot;journalism&quot; is making another victim.
Philosopher and activist Richard Matthew Stallman is having his ideas
distorted and his writings taken out of context just so a
&quot;journalist&quot; can get re-tweets from people that didn't even
  read their article.</p>

<p>After reading this, if you agree that Stallman suffered an injustice. Please consider signing this <a href="https://www.change.org/p/journalists-to-stop-the-persecution-of-stallman-and-apologize-publicly">petition</a>.</p>

<p>Now to what actually happened. In chronological order. (Not as
long as it seems. Most of it are quotations from original sources
  because I'm not an incompetent &quot;journalist&quot;.)</p>

<p><strong>First some background.</strong></p>

<p>Jeffrey Edward Epstein was an American financier and convicted sex
offender. Epstein began his professional life as a teacher, then
changed to the banking and finance sector in various roles. Epstein
developed an elite social circle, and allegedly procured women and
girls, many underage, to provide sexual services for himself and some
  of these contacts.[1]</p>

<p><strong>Now to the matter at hand.</strong></p>
<p>On August 9, 2019 the news site The Verge published an article[2]
about the testimony of one of Epstein victims. In the testimony, the
woman says she was directed to have sex with Marvin Minsky. Mr.
Minsky was a pioneer on artificial intelligence research and a
  professor at MIT. Stallman was also a pioneer at AI research at MIT.</p>

<p><strong>The storm begins.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One month later</strong> an article was posted to medium,
with the title &quot;Remove Richard Stallman - And everyone else
horrible in tech.&quot; by Ms. Selam.[3] There was a facebook event
calling for a protest regarding donations Jeffrey Epstein made to
MIT. Stallman objected to the wording of the description of the
event. Objecting to choices of words is something he is known for
doing, he is a philosopher after all. It would be wrong to jump to
  the conclusion that he did so only to protect a friend.</p>

<p>The objection was the following:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; The announcement of the Friday event does
an injustice to Marvin</em><br/>
<em>&nbsp;Minsky:</em></p>
<p><em>“deceased AI ‘pioneer’ Marvin Minsky (who is accused of
assaulting</em><br/>
<em>one of Epstein’s victims [2])”</em></p>
<p><em>The injustice is in the word “assaulting”. The term
“sexual assault”</em><br/>
<em>is so vague and slippery that it
facilitates accusation inflation:</em><br/>
<em>taking claims that
someone did X and leading people to think of it as</em><br/>
<em>Y,
which is much worse than X.</em></p>
<p><em>he accusation quoted is a clear example of inflation. The
reference</em><br/>
<em>reports the claim that Minsky had sex with
one of Epstein’s harem.</em><br/>
<em>(See
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey">https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey</a>
epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed.)</em><br/>
<em>Let’s
presume that was true (I see no reason to disbelieve it).</em></p>
<p><em>The word “assaulting” presumes that he applied force or
violence, in</em><br/>
<em>some unspecified way, but the article
itself says no such thing.</em><br/>
<em>Only that they had sex.</em></p>
<p><em>We can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario
is that</em><br/>
<em>she presented herself to him as entirely
willing. Assuming she was</em><br/>
<em>being coerced by Epstein, he
would have had every reason to tell her</em><br/>
<em>to conceal that
from most of his associates.</em></p>
<p><em>I’ve concluded from various examples of accusation inflation
that it</em><br/>
<em>is absolutely wrong to use the term “sexual
assault” in an accusation.</em></p>
<p><em>Whatever conduct you want to criticize, you should describe it
with a</em><br/>
<em>specific term that avoids moral vagueness about
the nature of the</em><br/>
<em>criticism. &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p>
</div>
<p>We can note two things here:</p>

<p>1. He **is not** disbelieving the possibility that Mr. Minsky did
indeed have intercourse with a minor. &quot;Let’s presume that was
  true (I see no reason to disbelieve it).&quot;</p>

<p>2. He **is** saying that the girl could have presented herself as
entirely willing. This means that Mr. Minsky would not be aware of
the fact that girl was being forced to have sex with him. It's very
important to understand that he said that the girl **could** have
**presented** herself as willingly. He **did not** say that the girl
  was in fact willingly having sex with Mr. Minsky.</p>

<p>The article goes to on to say, shortly after, quoting this same
  e-mail, that:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; …and then he says that an enslaved child
    could, somehow, be “entirely willing”. &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p>
</div>

<p>Which we can clearly see he did not do. The author of the article
is a mechanical engineer and a not a professional journalist.
Moreover she admits to be very upset while writing the article. So
  maybe this was an innocent mistake.</p>

<p>The rest of the article talks about the under-representation of
women in STEM and Includes a picture of Stallman's room door at MIT
  with a sign that reads:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; Richard Stallman: Knight for justice (Also:
    Hot ladies) &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p>
</div>

<p>And claims this to be &quot;problematic&quot;.<br/>
There are then
two more pictures of Stallman's emails deemed &quot;problematics&quot;
and a link[4] to the geek feminism wiki with other &quot;problematic&quot;
  quotes.</p>

<p>The article ends with:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; Perhaps the only criticism I will accept is
that I, personally, have been </em><br/>
<em>lucky enough to avoid a
  lot of gender-related discrimination in comparison to my peers. &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately it seems that this person is not open to criticisms.</p>
<p><strong>The disinformation machine at work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On September 13, 2019</strong> the periodic MOTHERBOARD
published an article titled “Famed Computer Scientist Richard
Stallman Described Epstein Victims As 'Entirely Willing'”[5]. <br/>
As
we’ve seen, Stallman did not say or imply that one girl was
entirely willingly having sex with Mr. Minsky, much less that all of
Epstein victims were (note the letter “s” on the title of the
article after the &quot;victim&quot; word, denoting plural).</p>
<p>As we've seen, Stallman said that one girl **could** have
**presented** herself to Mr. Minsky willingly.</p>
<p>The article then goes on with it’s defamation, the first
  paragraph reads:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; Richard Stallman, the computer scientist
best known for his role in the&nbsp; free software movement, has
joined the list of MIT men going out of their way to defend the
university’s relationships with convicted sex offender Jeffrey
    Epstein. &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p>
</div>
<p>The “journalist” uses the article posted by Ms. Selam on
  medium(the one above) as it’s source. The defamation goes on:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; Early in the thread, Stallman insists that
the “most plausible scenario”&nbsp; is that Epstein’s underage
    victims were “entirely willing” while being&nbsp; trafficked. &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p>
</div>
<p>Again two mistakes. Stallman did not talk about all of Epstein
victims and he did not say that they were entirely willingly.</p>
<p>All this misinformation is then followed by:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; Stallman goes on to argue about the
definition of “sexual assault,” “rape,” and whether they
apply to Minsky and Giuffre’s deposition statement that she was
forced to have sex with him.</em></p>
<p><em>In response to a student pointing out that Giuffre was 17 when
she was forced to have sex with Minsky in the Virgin Islands,
Stallman&nbsp; said “it is morally absurd to define ‘rape’ in a
way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or
    whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.” &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p>
</div>
<p>None of which is contained the medium article by Ms. Selam.
Instead, this is all in a 20 page screen shot of a mail list at the
bottom of the page[6]. The screen shot has 20 pages because the
“journalist” didn’t bother formatting it for presentation, he
just detracted addresses from other people that not Stallman. It has
in fact around 10 very short messages.</p>
<p>The message from which the quote: “it is morally absurd to
  define ‘rape’ [...]” was taken is this one:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot;Giuffre was 17 at the time; this makes it
__rape__ in the Virgin Isiands.</em><br/>
<em>Does it really? I think
it is morally absurd to define &quot;rape&quot; in a</em><br/>
<em>way
that depends on minor details such as which country it was in
or</em><br/>
<em>whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.</em></p>
<p><em>I think the existence of a dispute about that supports my
point that</em><br/>
<em>the term &quot;sexual assault&quot; is
slippery, so we ought to use more</em><br/>
<em>concrete terms when
accusing anyone.</em></p>
<p><em>&gt; The Verge article includes the deposition snippet, which
is not</em><br/>
<em>&gt; ambiguous at all: Giuffre directly says she
was forced to have sex</em><br/>
<em>&gt; with Minsky.</em></p>
<p><em>I don't see any quotation from the deposition in the article,
but it</em><br/>
<em>says, &quot;Giuffre says she was directed to
have sex with Minsky.&quot; Given</em><br/>
<em>the circumstances,
that implies she was coerced by Epstein into doing</em><br/>
<em>so.</em></p>
<p><em>The article I know of, and have a copy of,
is</em><br/>
<em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed">https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed</a></em><br/>
<em>Are
you talking of some other Verge article? If so, would you like
to</em><br/>
<em>tell me its URL?</em></p>
<p><em>&gt; Let's stop grasping at straws to defend our friends, and
instead</em><br/>
<em>&gt; listen to the women who were harmed.</em></p>
<p><em>We can listen only to what is said to us.</em></p>
<p><em>All i know she said about Minsky is that Epstein directed her
to have</em><br/>
<em>sex with Minsky. That does not say whether
Minsky knew that she was</em><br/>
<em>coerced. It does not report
what each said and did during their</em><br/>
<em>sexual encounter.
We can imagine various scenarios.</em></p>
<p><em>We know that Giuffre was being coerced into sex -- by Epstein.
She</em><br/>
<em>was being harmed. But the details do affect
whether, and to what</em><br/>
<em>extent, Minsky was responsible for
that.</em></p>
<p><em>Looking through the article again carefully, I found a link
that reportedly</em><br/>
<em>points to the deposition itself. I
visited that URL and got a blank window. It&nbsp; is on Google Drive,
which demands running nonfree software in order to see it. See
</em><br/>
<em><a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html</a></em><br/>
<em>Would
you (not anyone else!) like to email me a copy of the part that&nbsp;
pertains to Minsky? I say “not anyone else” to avoid getting 20
  copies. &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p>
</div>
<p>As we can see, his point can be boiled down to:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; We know that Giuffre was being coerced into
sex -- by Epstein. She was being harmed. But the details do affect
    whether, and to what extent, Minsky was responsible for that. &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p>
</div>
<p>Or in other words, that the girl **could** have **presented**
herself to Mr. Minsky as willingly.</p>
<p>The articles then talks about the resignation of another
completely different professor, Joi Ito, for reasons that are beyond
my understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Also on September 13, 2019</strong> another (un)renowned
information source, The Daily Beast, published an article[7] on the
subject. The title of this one was “Renowned MIT Scientist Defends
Epstein: Victims Were ‘Entirely Willing’ - MIT bigwig Richard
Stallman dismissed Epstein’s underage victims in emails and
defended child pornography on his blog.”</p>
<p>It starts with:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; While MIT engages in damage control
following revelations the university’s Media Lab accepted millions
of dollars in funding from Jeffrey Epstein, a renowned computer
scientist at the university has fanned the flames by apparently going
out of his way to defend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    accused sex trafficker—and child pornography in general. &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p>
</div>
<p>As we’ve seen, Stallman did not defend the sex trafficker,
Epstein, he merely criticized the wording used to refer to Mr.
Minsky. Crude mistake for such a renowned information source.</p>
<p>They then go on to repeat the same thing as The Verge:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; his eminence in the academic computer
science community came into question Friday afternoon when
purportedly leaked email excerpts showed him suggesting one of
    Epstein’s alleged victims was “entirely willing.” &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p>
</div>
<p>Stallman never said the victims were “entirely willingly”,
only that they **could** have been **presented** to Mr. Minsky as
entirely willingly, as we’ve seen in the original emails above. But
hey, it’s 2019, what do we need fact for right?</p>
<p>The author then mentions the fact that the emails are available in
  full and repeats the same mistake.</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; Stallman wrote that “the most plausible
scenario” for Giuffre’s accusations was that she was, in
actuality, “entirely willing.” Vice’s Motherboard later
reprinted the emails in full. Gano did not immediately respond to a
request for comment. &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p></div>
<p>I guess they are being paid to write, not read, right?</p>
<p>The renowned news paper report on the matter ends here. The rest
of the article, which constitutes most of it, is actually just
quotations from Stallmans personal blog that are deemed
“questionable”. Nothing he posted at the MIT mailing list. At the
  bottom of stallman.org we can read:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; This is the personal web site of Richard
Stallman. The views expressed here are my personal views, not those
    of the Free Software Foundation or the GNU Project. &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p>
</div>
<p>But “journalists” are paid to write, not read. And all the
other cool kids are already playing witch hunt anyways so what?</p>
<p>The first quote from stallman’s blog is:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; “This ‘child pornography’ might be a
photo of yourself&nbsp; or your lover that the two of you shared. It
might be an image of a sexually mature teenager that any normal adult
would find attractive. What’s heinous about having such a photo?”&nbsp;
Stallman wrote in 2011 on his personal site, stallman.org, in an
argument in favor of Congress limiting laptop searches at the U.S.
    border.&quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p>
</div>
<p>Which does not include an URL, fortunately, I bothered searching
  for it [8]:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; Campaigning for Congress to limit searches
of laptops at the US border.</em></p>
<p><em>The same should be done for police when they stop drivers.</em></p>
<p><em>The article falls into a common kind of error when it says
that &quot;possession of child pornography is a heinous offense&quot;.
It is the error of rhetorically legitimizing the previous attack
    against our rights in arguing against the next one.</em></p>
<p><em>This &quot;child pornography&quot; might be a photo of
yourself or your lover that the two of you shared. It might be an
image of a sexually mature teenager that any normal adult&nbsp; would
find attractive. What's heinous about having such a photo?</em></p>
<p><em>But even when it is uncontroversial to call the subject
depicted a &quot;child&quot;, that is no excuse for censorship.
Having a photo or drawing does not hurt anyone, so and if you or I
think it is disgusting, that is no excuse for censorship.</em></p>
<p><em>The government will invent an unlimited number of
opportunities to censor us and search us if we grant the legitimacy
of its all-purpose excuses for doing so.&quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p></div>
<p>It seems that the general points are two.</p>
<p>1. The search of laptops should have a probable cause and not be
preemptive:</p>
<div class="quote"><p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; the error of rhetorically legitimizing the
previous attack against our rights in arguing against the next
one.&quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p></div>
<p>2. And that, depending on the context, what is technically child
pornography didn’t cause anyone harm.</p>
<div class="quote"><p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; This &quot;child pornography&quot; might be
a photo of yourself or your lover that the two of you shared.&quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p></div>
<p>Think of a couple in which one is 19 years old and the other is
17.</p>
<p>He then says that the mere possession of child pornography does
not harm anyone. I assume he is implying that only the production of
child pornography harms people.</p>
<div class="quote"><p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; But even when it is uncontroversial to call
the subject depicted a &quot;child&quot;, that is no excuse for
censorship. Having a photo or drawing does not hurt anyone, so and if
you or I think it is disgusting, that is no excuse for censorship.&quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p></div>
<p>I would disagree with that, but it’s his personal blog. He is
not speaking for the MIT or the free software foundation.</p>
<p>Also note that he says “if you or I think it is disgusting”.</p>
<p>Now to the second “questionable” quote. It very conveniently
does not have a link but it can be found at [9]. The renowned news
source writes:</p>
<div class="quote"><p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; “I disagree with some of what the article
says about Epstein. Epstein is not, apparently, a pedophile, since
the people he raped seem to have all been postpuberal.” He
preferred to call Epstein a “serial rapist.” &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p></div>
<p>And the writing in it’s entirety is here:</p>
<div class="quote"><p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot;(Now) Labor Secretary Acosta's plea deal for
Jeffrey Epstein was not only extremely lenient, it was so lenient
that it was illegal.</em></p>
<p><em>I wonder whether this makes it possible to resentence him to a
longer prison term.</em></p>
<p><em>I disagree with some of what the article says about Epstein.
Epstein is not, apparently, a pedophile, since the people he raped
seem to have all been postpuberal.</em></p>
<p><em>By contrast, calling him a &quot;sex offender&quot; tends to
minimize his crimes, since it groups him with people who committed a
spectrum of acts of varying levels of gravity. Some of them were not
crimes. Some of these people didn't actually do anything to anyone.</em></p>
<p><em>I think the right term for a person such as Epstein is &quot;serial
rapist&quot;. &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p></div>
<p>So Stallman actually held the opinion that Epstein should have
gotten a longer sentence and that “sex offender” was too light of
a term.</p>
<p>Maybe we could say the way the renowned news source quoted is
Stallman is questionable.</p>
<p>To the third “questionable” quote. This time at least they
provided the source[10] but the choice of what sentences to include
in the article could be called questionable.</p>
<p>The Daily Beast writes:</p>
<div class="quote"><p><em>&quot;&quot;&quot; In 2003, he said, “I think that everyone
age 14 or above ought to take part in sex, though not
indiscriminately. (Some people are ready earlier.)”</em></p>
<p><em>Alan Dershowitz, one of the lawyers who helped broker
Epstein’s 2008 sweetheart plea deal, has also argued against age of
consent laws, calling statutory rape an “outdated concept” in a
1997 op-ed and suggesting on Twitter in July that a 16-year-old
should have the “constitutional right” to consensual sex. &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p></div>
<p>The original reads:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>&quot;&quot;&quot; <em>The UK is planning a censorship law that
would prohibit &quot;giving a (so-called) child anything that relates
to sexual activity or contains a reference to such activity&quot;.
This clearly includes most novels that you can buy in an ordinary
book store.</em></p>
<p><em>As usual, the term &quot;child&quot; is used as a form of
deception, since it includes teenagers of an age at which a large
fraction&nbsp; of people are sexually active nowadays. People we
would not normally call children.</em></p>
<p><em>The law would also prohibit &quot;encouraging a (so-called)
child to take part in sexual activity.&quot; I think that everyone
age 14 or above ought to take part in sex, though not
indiscriminately. (Some people are ready earlier.) It is unnatural
for humans to abstain from sex past puberty, and while I wouldn't try
to pressure anyone to participate, I certainly encourage everyone to
do so.</em></p>
<p><em>This web site is currently hosted in the UK. If the law is
adopted, will my web site be a crime? I will have to talk with the
people who host the site about whether I should move it to another
country.</em></p>
<p><em>(The hosting company responded that I don't need to move.) &quot;&quot;&quot;</em></p></div>
<p>The original blog post contains a link to The Guardian[11]. If you
read it, you will notice that the other people concerned with the
bill are the editors of a teen magazine that fear they won’t be
able to offer advice on contraceptives to girls that are mostly
between the ages of 15 and 16 years old.</p>
<p>I wonder if The Daily Beast is against such a thing. It would be
very questionable for such a renowned news source.</p>
<p>If you pay attention to the wording on the renowned news source
you will see that they say:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<em> also argued against age of consent laws</em>
&quot;&quot;&quot;</p></div>
<p>Implying that Stallman argued against age of consent laws. I read
this blog post many times and I find this claim to be questionable.
I’m not a lawyer, I do not know whether such accusation is a crime.</p>
<p>The fourth quote is:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>&quot;&quot;&quot; <em>Stallman was apparently also quite open
about his ideas not only on age of consent laws, but also pedophilia.
In 2006, he wrote, “I am skeptical of the claim that voluntarily
pedophilia harms children. The arguments that it causes harm seem to
be based on cases which aren't voluntary, which are then stretched by
parents who are horrified by the idea that their little baby is
maturing.” The law does not allow for “voluntary” pedophilia.</em>
&quot;&quot;&quot;</p></div>
<p>There is not much to say about it **now**.</p>
<p>The fifth quote is:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>&quot;&quot;&quot; <em>In 2006, he said it wouldn’t so bad for
an adult man who worked for the Department of Homeland Security to
have sex with a 14-year-old, as one government employee had
allegedly[...]</em> &quot;&quot;</p></div>
<p>There is a link for this one but it’s broken. We will have to
take the word of the renowned news source on that one.</p>
<p>The sixth “questionable” quote:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>&quot;&quot;&quot; <em>He reiterated his point in 2013: “There
is little evidence to justify the widespread assumption that willing
participation in pedophilia hurts children.”</em> &quot;&quot;&quot;</p></div>
<p>Let’s see the original:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>&quot;&quot;&quot; <em>There is little evidence to justify the
widespread assumption that willing participation in pedophilia hurts
children.</em></p>
<p><em>Granted, children may not dare say no to an older relative, or
may not realize they could say no; in that case, even if they do not
overtly object, the relationship may still feel imposed to them.
That's not willing participation, it's imposed participation, a
different issue.</em> &quot;&quot;&quot;</p></div>
<p>Who could have guessed that context matters. The integrity of this
renowned “journalist” is beginning to look very questionable.</p>
<p>You think this is all dirty? There is more:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>&quot;&quot;&quot; <em>People within the tech industry knew of
Stallman’s remarks, chattering about his controversial claims in
social networking sites and forums at least since last year, but his
remarks about Epstein’s victims reignited the debate Friday. The
digital trail of Stallman’s remarks and the whisper network
surrounding them raise the question of whether MIT and the Free
Software Foundation knew of his controversial statements.</em> &quot;&quot;&quot;</p></div>
<p>The people on the industry are two users of Ycombiantor[12]
talking about the fourth quote and a woman on twitter posting the day
before the article was published and talking about the exact same
thing as those two articles and using the exact same arguments.</p>
<p>The seventh questionable quote:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>&quot;&quot;&quot; <em>In 2003, he wrote a post about a judge who
argued that repealing an Alabama anti-sodomy law would lead to the
legalization of &quot;prostitution, adultery, necrophilia,
bestiality, possession of child pornography, and even incest and
pedophilia.” The computer scientist responded, “All of these acts
should be legal as long as no one is coerced. They are illegal only
because of prejudice and narrowmindedness.”</em> &quot;&quot;&quot;</p></div>
<p>The original reads:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>&quot;&quot;&quot; <em>Dubya has nominated another caveman for a
federal appeals court. Refreshingly, the Democratic Party is
organizing opposition. </em><br/>
<em>[Reference updated on
2018-05-10 because the old link was broken.]</em></p>
<p><em>The nominee is quoted as saying that if the choice of a sexual
partner were protected by the Constitution, &quot;prostitution,
adultery, necrophilia, bestiality, possession of child pornography,
and even incest and pedophilia&quot; also would be. He is probably
mistaken, legally--but that is unfortunate. All of these acts should
be legal as long as no one is coerced. They are illegal only because
of prejudice and narrowmindedness.</em></p>
<p><em>Some rules might be called for when these acts directly affect
other people's interests. For incest, contraception could be
mandatory to avoid risk of inbreeding. For prostitution, a license
should be required to ensure prostitutes get regular medical
check-ups, and they should have training and support in insisting on
use of condoms. This will be an advance in public health, compared
with the situation today.</em></p>
<p><em>For necrophilia, it might be necessary to ask the next of kin
for permission if the decedent's will did not authorize it.
Necrophilia would be my second choice for what should be done with my
corpse, the first being scientific or medical use. Once my dead body
is no longer of any use to me, it may as well be of some use to
someone. Besides, I often enjoy rhinophytonecrophilia (nasal sex with
dead plants).</em> &quot;&quot;&quot;</p></div>
<p>All those questionable quotes seem very reasonable when put in
context. I wonder if The Daily Beast finds questionable that sex
workers should get training, medical check-ups and use condoms. I
wonder what their readers would think about that.</p>
<p>Just two more questionable quotes to go.</p>
<p>The eighth one, this one is kinda funny:</p>
<p>The renowned news source writes:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>&quot;&quot;&quot; <em>Stallman extended his argument to say that
internet censorship is worse than child pornography: “The term
‘child pornography’ is dishonest. The censorship of it puts young
lovers in direct danger of prosecution. Many published works are
disgusting, but censorship is more so.”</em> &quot;&quot;&quot;</p></div>
<p>The original reads:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>&quot;&quot;&quot; <em>&quot;Child&quot; pornography is being used
as an excuse to threaten all American internet users' privacy.</em></p>
<p><em>The term &quot;child pornography&quot; is dishonest. The
censorship of it puts young lovers in direct danger of prosecution.</em></p>
<p><em>Many published works are disgusting, but censorship is more
so. In the Internet, enforcement of censorship puts other rights in
danger.</em></p>
<p><em>Please support demandprogress.org's campaign against this
bill.</em> &quot;&quot;&quot;</p></div>
<p>When Stallman says that child pornography is being used to
threaten internet users, he is referring to [13], a bill that woul
force ISPs to save IP addresses logs for at least one year.</p>
<p>When he says that “child pornography” is dishonest he is
referring to the use of it to justify the search of laptops at
borders without plausible cause. Which the author already talked
about but didn’t provide source[8]. I wonder if he read this post
and it’s links before publishing it. I think he didn’t, otherwise
he would have been able to provide the source to that other
“questionable” quote.</p>
<p>When he says “direct danger of prosecution”, he is linking
to [14]:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>&quot;&quot;&quot; <em>The &quot;child pornography&quot;
witch-hunt has made a possession of this high-school yearbook a
crime&nbsp;— because of what two students in the background of a
photo are doing. Imagine if the photo had been published in a
newspaper. That could turn thousands of people into criminals.</em></p>
<p><em>Doing foreplay in a dance is a little daring — it must have
been fun. It suggests those two students are normal teenagers with a
normal interest in sex. If there was anything harmful, wrong, or
shameful about this photo, it wasn't them. Yet (according to an
article on a site not suitable to link to) they might face
prosecution, with the danger of being listed as &quot;sex offenders&quot;,
effectively &quot;perverts&quot;, for being normal and hurting
nobody.</em></p>
<p><em>These laws are the perverted intersection of two irrational
hot buttons: &quot;sex is dirty&quot; and &quot;we must protect the
children&quot;. Remember this when Internet filtering is imposed in
order to block &quot;child pornography&quot;.</em> &quot;&quot;&quot;</p></div>
<p>I wonder if the renowned news source thinks teenagers should
abstain from sex until marriage. Their readers might think this
position is questionable.</p>
<p>The nine-th quote is actually the same as the first one but this
time it does have a link. Apparently the author didn’t read the
sources or even what he wrote. Guess he is really being paid to
write, not read. Renowned journalism at it’s best.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Back to the beginning.</b></p>
<p><b>On September 16, 2019</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> Ms.
Selam, the one from the first blog post, wrote again [14].  On the
third paragraph we read:</span></p>
<div class="quote"><p>“””<i><span style="font-weight: normal">I had no idea that
Richard Stallman has been so problematic, in so many different ways,
for so long. I did not know that Richard Stallman has been making MIT
a worse learning environment for decades, and that somehow, that
behavior went on completely unchecked.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: normal">”””</span></i></p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">As
we’ve seen he has not been “problematic”. Incompetent
“journalists” have been “problematic”.</span></p>
<p style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">A few
paragraphs below, we have: </span>
</p>
<div class="quote"><p><a name="9e71"></a><a name="8395"></a>“”” <i><span style="font-weight: normal">I
hope this gets through to everyone who has responded saying we
“should not jump to conclusions” or “be less punitive”. We
have been lenient — in fact, we have been negligent — for
decades.</span></i></p>
<p><a name="7089"></a><i>Others have already dug up a good chunk of
Stallman’s public history. This Daily Beast article does a great
job covering his long history of problematic views on child
pornography and statutory rape: “””</i></p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal">Want to guess what article of The Daily
Beast, the renowned news source, is linked? That’s right, the very
questionable one that we just read above.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">It
goes on:</span></p>
<div class="quote"><p>“””<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Some people have
described Stallman as “controversial” — this could mean a
few different things, but I do not think that Stallman’s </span></i><em><span style="font-weight: normal">opinions</span></em><i><span style="font-weight: normal">
are controversial. “Controversial” implies that 40% of the public
thinks one way and another 40% the other, and some 20% are
in-between.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: normal">”””</span></i></p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">I
think Mr. Merrian-Webster would disagree with that:</span></p>
<p style="font-style: normal">“<span style="font-weight: normal">Controversial”
according to Merrian-Webster:</span></p>
<div class="quote"><p>“””<i><span style="font-weight: normal">of, relating to, or
arousing <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/controversy">controversy</a>”””</span></i></p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">In
turn, the definition of “controversy” is:</span></p>
<div class="quote"><p>“””<i><span style="font-weight: normal">a discussion marked
especially by the expression of opposing views”””</span></i></p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">Interesting,
this says nothing about percentages. I wonder if this very odd
definition will prove useful later in the text.</span></p>
<p style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">Let’s
read the rest of the paragraph:</span></p>
<div class="quote"><p>“””<i><span style="font-weight: normal">If there are a large
number of people in the United States who think that child
pornography and sexual intercourse with minors should be legalized,
this is the first I’m hearing of it, and please show me the
evidence. “””</span></i></p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal"> <span style="font-weight: normal">I
don’t think there is and if there are, as we saw, Stallman is not
one of them. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">The paragraph
goes on:</span></p>
<div class="quote"><p>“””<i><span style="font-weight: normal">Since it is not
controversial, I’m not going to argue why these opinions are
problematic. Having to “prove” this would give legitimacy to
Stallman’s ideas.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: normal">”””</span></i></p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">B</span><span style="font-weight: normal">ut
you already did argue. Not arguing would be to take “Stallmans
opinions are problematic.” as an axiom.</span></p>
<p>The opinions are not controversial (by your weird definition) and
you don’t like them. =&gt; The opinions are problematic.</p>
<p>At least we now know what those people call “problematic”.</p>
<p>Not that any of this matters. This is all, as we’ve seen, a big
strawman (pun intended). You are attacking the lies written (and not
read, he is not being paid for this) of a sub-par “journalist”.
That journalist is in turn only writing this lies because he saw(not
read, he is not being paid for this) your last blog post. This kinda
sounds like an echo chamber.</p>
<p>A few more gaffes before we go to the next section of the article:</p>
<div class="quote"><p><a name="40b7"></a>“””<i>MIT, by endorsing Stallman, also
gives legitimacy to these ideas.</i><i>“””</i></p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal">No. It does not. As stated in his blog,
his opinions are his own. Not that it matters, since you are not
attacking his opinions, you are attacking the opinions of an
illiterate “journalist”.</p>
<div class="quote"><p>“””<i>I would also like to clarify that in some headlines,
including this Daily Beast one, Stallman is said to have defended
Epstein, </i><strong><i>which is not technically true. </i></strong><i>Rather,
Stallman was defending Marvin Minsky. I directly emailed and
corrected reporters who used that language if I myself had given them
any comments or information. I say this to show that I never intended
to “inflate” anything, because there was absolutely no need
to.</i><i>”””</i></p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal">Excellent, but unfortunately those
reporters are not being paid to read, only to write. The headlines
and disinformation are all still there.</p>
<div class="quote"><p><a name="1a69"></a>“””<i>The truth by itself was far, far
more than enough.</i><i>”””</i></p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal">The truth that you got from the
“journalists” that can’t even write a headline or check the
facts of a half-page article?</p>
<p style="font-style: normal"><b>To the second section of the article
now. You might have already noticed but it has nothing to do with the
initial matter anymore. Someone hit a target and now wants to make
sure it’s a bullseye.</b></p>
<div class="quote"><p>“””<i>In this section, I acknowledge that I do not have as
many photos, emails, or written records as evidence. I do, however,
have witnesses.</i><i>”””</i></p></div>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">The author then provider the
personal experience of a few alumni as far back as 1980. The first
one:</span></p>
<div class="quote"><p>“””<i>I recall being told early in my freshman year “If
RMS hits on you, just say ‘I’m a vi user’ even if it’s not
true.”</i><i>”””</i></p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal">This seems to be a joke from one
student to another, not something Stallman did. The joke seems also
to be about the fact that Stallman is an avid advocate of Emacs and
that there is a very famous internet flame war between Emacs and Vi
users. It doesn’t say anything about Stallman behavior towards
women. The same joke could have been made about a serial rapist or a
noun.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal">To the second of the “horrifying
stories”:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>“””“<i>He literally used to have a mattress on the floor
of his office. He kept the door to his office open, to proudly
showcase that mattress and all the implications that went with it.
Many female students avoided the corridor with his office for that
reason…I was one of the course 6 undergrads who avoided that part
of NE43 precisely for that reason. (the mattress was also known to
have shirtless people lounging on it…)”</i> 
</p>
<p><em>— </em><i>Bachelor’s in Computer Science, ‘99 </i>“””</p></div>
<p>Let’s take a look at [15], section “Home”, from Stallmans
personal website:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>“””<i>Until around 1998, my office at MIT was also my
residence. I was even registered to vote from there. Nowadays I have
a separate residence in Cambridge not far from MIT. However, I am
rarely there, since I am nearly always travelling out of town. </i><i>“””</i></p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal">I wonder what that dirty mattress was
used for. Maybe sleeping?</p>
<p style="font-style: normal">The next story does sound inappropriate
but given the context of lies I honestly don’t know what to think
of it. If it is true, I don’t think this alone could justify
everything that is being done to Stallman. I say “this alone”
because, as we’ve seen, the rest are lies and
mis-characterizations.</p>
<div class="quote"><p><a name="5746"></a>“””“<i>When I was a teen freshman, I
went to a buffet lunch at an Indian restaurant in Central Square with
a graduate student friend and others from the AI lab. I don’t know
if he and I were the last two left, but at a table with only the two
of us, Richard Stallman told me of his misery and that he’d kill
himself if I didn’t go out with him.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><a name="c293"></a><i>I
felt bad for him and also uncomfortable and manipulated. I did not
like being put in that position — suddenly responsible for an
“important” man. What had I done to get into this situation? I
decided I could not be responsible for his living or dying, and would
have to accept him killing himself. I declined further contact.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><a name="9cb0"></a><i>He
was not a man of his word or he’d be long dead.”</i></p>
<p><a name="7e05"></a><em>—</em><i>Betsy S., Bachelor’s in
Management Science, ’85</i> <i>“””</i></p></div>
<p>The stories end here. The author then gives her opinion:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>“””<i>But MIT is a privileged place. We have the right to
choose who we admit, hire, or endorse. We do not let just anyone on
our campus; we demand high standards of achievement. We should demand
high ethical standards equal to our high standards for achievement. I
do not think Richard Stallman ever met even a low ethical standard
for being at any university, and I am questioning mostly why this was
allowed to continue for so, so long.</i><i>”””</i></p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal">I agree with some of this. I do think
the MIT should demand higher ethical standards.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal">The section ends with a link to a
report[16] written by women of the CSAIL in 1980 (the one Stallman
worked at) about equality in academia. It might be a bit “culturally
dated” but it’s interesting and still have good ideas that could
be implemented.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal">The fact that the women of the CSAIL
wrote a report might indicate that the environment was not very women
friendly or it might indicate that it was so friendly(for the time’s
standard) that they were able to write it. 
</p>
<p style="font-style: normal">Nevertheless, it doesn’t say anything
about Stallman conduct, since there is not really any evidence for it
to corroborate. As we’ve seen all those “questionable” opinions
and behaviors were indeed mis-characterizations.</p>
<p><a name="fe03"></a>The author now goes to the third section,
titled: “Going Forward, be proactive instead of reactive.”, and
gives some genuinely good suggestions to improve an academic
environment. Unfortunately, her actions were not so good.</p>
<p>The article ends with:</p>
<div class="quote"><p><a name="90cc"></a>“”” <i>Today, I found out that Stallman
had issued a rather weak and confusing apology to the CSAIL mailing
list:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><a name="e1f7"></a>“<i>I
want to respond to the misleading media coverage of messages I<br/>
posted
about Marvin Minsky’s association with Jeffrey Epstein.
The<br/>
coverage totally mischaracterised my statements.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><a name="3510"></a><i>Headlines
say that I defended Epstein. Nothing could be further from<br/>
the
truth. I’ve called him a “serial rapist”, and said he deserved
to<br/>
be imprisoned. But many people now believe I defended him —
and<br/>
other inaccurate claims — and feel a real hurt because of
what they<br/>
believe I said.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><a name="7037"></a><i>I’m
sorry for that hurt. I wish I could have prevented
the<br/>
misunderstanding.”</i></p>
<p>“””</p></div>
<p style="font-style: normal">Which doesn’t seem like an apology,
but like someone that is feeling guilt for being caught in a
situation they had no real way to avoid.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal">Maybe we should end with a quote from
someone the mailing list where it all started:</p>
<div class="quote"><p style="font-style: normal">“”” <i>The job of scientists is
to evaluate evidence and seek truth. We have a social responsibility
to do that as well. I hope that we scientists will never evade our
social responsibility to seek and defend the truth out of fear that
the press will misconstrue our search. </i>“””</p></div>
